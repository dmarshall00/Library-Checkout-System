# Library Checkout Management System
This library management system online database will display students who are assigned certain books in a class. The user can retrieve information regarding a specific group out of the 25 students in the class, a specific student, or a specific book (listing of students that checked out that particular book).
### Description
There are a total of 78 books in the longlist.csv file and each student will check out 3 books. There are no duplicates. There are 3 students per group with 3 books allocated to each student. There are 25 students in the class and therefore 75 books will be allocated at maximum. This project will be treated as some sort of library management system. The purpose of the project is to repurpose the midterm project to demonstrate students who checked out a particular book and demonstrate which book has a student attached to it. Sequelize will be used for database simplification and abstraction, especially since there is a need for relational database interaction. Sequelize allows for rapid development, easy querying, and data validation and security. Python, the programming language, will be used alongside MySQL for user retrieval. The project is divided in frontend and backend tasks.
